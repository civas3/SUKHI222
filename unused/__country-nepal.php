                                        <h2>NEPAL SUKHI 222 PROPOSAL</h2>
                                        <p>SUKHI 222 is a Human Rights campaign which is equally essential in all countries but it plays a very important role in the developing countries like Nepal . At the initial phase of 222 around 300-350 families and children will get beneficial mostly the village from sindhupalchowk and dolakha (earthquake affected villages). Ourplan is to focus in the earthquake affected districts in the starting phase. Around 50- 70 families will get food and 150- 200 students will get stationary and 300-400 families will get clean water daily in the initial phase. Once the 222 gets established  we will extend our project to other parts of Nepal where 222 is urgentand needed.</p>
