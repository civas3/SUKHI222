                                        <p>SUKHI 222 is a Human Rights campaign which is equally essential in all countries but it plays a very important role in the developing countries like Nepal . At the initial phase of 222 around 300-350 families and children will get beneficial mostly the village from sindhupalchowk and dolakha (earthquake affected villages). Ourplan is to focus in the earthquake affected districts in the starting phase. Around 50- 70 families will get food and 150- 200 students will get stationary and 300-400 families will get clean water daily in the initial phase. Once the 222 gets established  we will extend our project to other parts of Nepal where 222 is urgentand needed.</p>

                                    <p>Children are the future. Nepal’s education system is of poor quality, especially in public schools.  Poverty and social exclusion of women, lower caste discrimination, and indigenous bias are nowadays the primary constraints to an equitable access to education. Many children have to drop their school due to poverty and they cannot afford for their stationary too. Children will start to work at early age instead of study and make money for their livelihood. To increase the number of children in the education sectors and help them to get interest in the education SUKHI 222 is working in education sectors. </p>

                                    <p>All people have equal rights to live. More than 25% of the people in Nepal are living below the poverty line,  having less than US $ 1 per day.  They are facing difficulties in day to day life. After huge earthquake peoples’ lifestyle is very hard and they even can’t afford themselves to make a good permanent shelter for them due to poverty. In Nepal it is estimated that around 80% of Total population has access to drinking water which is not safe. Many people in remote areas have to rely on Small Brooks running from the mountains and spend hours travelling to get water. Still the drinking water available is not always safe as supplied water is often polluted. To help and support them with 2 gallons of clean water, 2000 nutritional calories in 200 sq.ft of secure shelter 222 is needed. </p>
