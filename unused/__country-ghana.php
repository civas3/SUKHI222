                                        <p>The people in the target area trek long distances to collect water from the dug outs which are often contaminated. The women and children spend much of their time in getting pots of water for their drinking and usage purposes of which the time could have been used for other productive activities. Traditionally, poor rural women have worked alongside their husbands in fields, brought up children and managed the house, kept accounts, collected water, fuel wood, and fodder, looked after the animals.They are poorly educated (mostly illiterate), either due to the prevailing custom of not educating girl child or a lack of financial means while growing up, and they have little time or opportunity once they are married off mostly at very younger ages (between the ages of 15 to 18). The people especially, the children are affected with waterborne diseases such as cholera, bilharzia just to mention a few.</p>
