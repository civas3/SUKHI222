                                 <button class="accordion"><h2>BACKGROUND PROBLEM <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h2></button>
                                    <div class="panel">
                                        <p>Rural women can spend hours every day collecting and carting water, either from communal taps or directly from streams and rivers. Long cartage distances pose particular difficulties for elderly people and those with disabilities.</p>
                                        <p>Water is a critical commodity for development and growth. In fact, all civilizations have evolved around water. However, though the World has advanced into its 21st century, access to safe drinking water for all remains a challenge. According to the Global Water supply and Sanitation Assessment Report, Over one billion people across the world do not have access to adequate and safe drinking water facilities.</p>
                                        <p>In many Sub-Saharan African countries, drinking water supply and sanitation pose major challenges to the entire population. The most pressing issues are irregular supply of drinking water, longer time periods spent in accessing water, large water loss on the way to the consumer and low water pressure. Inequity and inequality in distribution and access to water also continues to be a challenge to the population. In the midst of all these challenges, rural communities are the most vulnerable.</p>
                                        <p>In urban areas, water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment facilities fail to satisfy needs and demands of large shares of the population. Therefore, Ghana's water industry has been the subject of constant reform efforts since the 1990s. The aim was to involve private companies, among others, to decentralize the rural water supply in the 230 districts and to promote municipal participation in water management. However, it was only with the establishment of the National Water Policy 2008 that a stringent, targeted strategy was pursued. Simultaneous to these reforms, the sector agencies put together subsector investment plans aimed at marshalling resources to address corporate targets, although in the 1990s these were not effectively aligned with set national targets.</p>
                                        <p>In recent years both the Community Water & Sanitation Agency (CWSA) and Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) have developed Strategic Investment Plans (SIPs) that have considered the country’s coverage targets—structured into medium-term and long-term—and there has been more open discussion of these documents by sector stakeholders. Whilst there is still some disconnect between targets and resource allocation, there is evidence to suggest that these are increasingly being aligned. The reforms have raised the visibility and importance of water and sanitation in the respective ministries (Ministry of Sanitation & Water Resources for water supply; Ministry of Local Government & Rural Development (MoLGRD) for sanitation)</p>
                                        <p>As a result, the people of Laligu community are constantly exposed to many infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria and protozoan parasites which are widespread health risk of drinking water in the community and hence contracting many water borne, skin infections and life threatening diseases such as typhoid fever, cholera, gastroenteritis and ringworm.</p>
                                        <p>Women and children, especially those living in rural areas, are disproportionately affected. Poor communities are often unable to afford the costs of maintaining pumps and bore holes, or lack the skills to do so.</p>

                                <button class="accordion"><h2>COMUNITY PROFILE <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h2></button>
                                    <div class="panel">
                                        <p>Laligu is a rural community located in the Northern region of Ghana. It has an estimated population of over 2500. The major challenge the community faces is access to portable drinking water. </p>
                                        <p>Over the years, private organizations have tried to support the community by drilling boreholes but it proved futile after some months because, the pumps are unable to pump water out as a result of the drop in the water table hence, boreholes are unable to recharge level.</p>
                                        <p>The community relies on a small dugout which dries up completely during the dry season (i.e. from November to April), thereby making it difficult to access water for both human and livestock. They travel 4 miles to fetch water.</p>
                                        <p>The chief and opinion leaders tried organizing a fund raising campaign to rehabilitate the dugout but funds ran out after just three days of hiring a machine (Excavators) to dig the dugout.</p>
                                        <p>Interactions with the chief and opinion leaders in the community revealed that, there is a deep need for safe drinking water in the community. </p>
                                        <p>The community needs intervention and SUKHI 222 is therefore is seeking support from philanthropist and humanitarian organizations to come to their aid by rehabilitating the dugout, building a rain water harvest in the school for kids and also extending pipe borne water from the district capital to the community.</p>

                                <button class="accordion"><h2>PROBLEMS AND WATER CHALLENGES CURRENTLY FACED <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i></h2></button>
                                    <div class="panel">
                                        <p>The people in the target area trek long distances to collect water from the dug outs which are often contaminated. The women and children spend much of their time in getting pots of water for their drinking and usage purposes of which the time could have been used for other productive activities. Traditionally, poor rural women have worked alongside their husbands in fields, brought up children and managed the house, kept accounts, collected water, fuel wood, and fodder, looked after the animals. </p>
                                        <p>They are poorly educated (mostly illiterate), either due to the prevailing custom of not educating girl child or a lack of financial means while growing up, and they have little time or opportunity once they are married off mostly at very younger ages (between the ages of 15 to 18). The people especially, the children are affected with waterborne diseases such as cholera, bilharzia just to mention a few.</p>
                                        <p>The provision of safe drinking water is a key development issue in the target areas, where rural households have no access to clean and safe drinking water. Rural households in the rural districts suffer frequent outbreaks of cholera bilharzias, and gastroenteritis. Some of the challenges in providing clean water in rural areas include geographic remoteness, poor maintenance of existing systems, and a paucity of public funds. Social factors also contribute to poor service levels in rural areas, notably the caste system and high rates of illiteracy. Providing safe drinking water to poor families in the rural areas of Laligu is critical for the economic development of the region as well as for improving health and living conditions.</p>
                                        <p>The general situation is dismal. The target rural households had no access to sanitation facilities and no latrine facilities except for the school which has a Latrine. The rural households, thus, use ‘the bush’ or practice the open defecation systems. Our Project beneficiaries belong to Backward Class, Scheduled Caste and Tribal communities who are poor and marginalized. The beneficiaries are laborers in the agricultural fields and some of them go to nearby town in search of their livelihood. While taking our surveys in the remote villages, the people in the community came forward and explained about the need to combat the scarcity of Water. The community came forward with their participation in rehabilitating the dugout, building a rainwater harvest facility or collection system for the school and an extension for pipe borne water from the district capital to the community.</p>
                                        <p>Community meetings are arranged with village people. This is to mobilize interest and enthusiasm as well as raise awareness about the project. The location of the project is the existing dugout; the Rain Water Harvest System will be built in the community school and an extension for pipe borne water from the district capital to the community. Women and Children are considered beneficiaries in this Project.</p>

                                    <div class="panel">
                                        <p>SUKHI 222 is an Organization that is committed to serve the vulnerable people in the community for their Sustainable Development and also attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing clean and safe drinking water to the targeted communities. SUKHI 222 has been extending services like the provision of water filters in the target areas. There is no doubt that Water and Sustainable Development are inextricably linked. Without adequate supplies and management of fresh water sources, sustainable development simply cannot take place. </p>
                                        <p>However, the resources are limited but there is a great need for safe water in the backward rural areas in the community. There are many communities where the dugouts provided by the Government are damaged and need rehabilitation and deepening to draw water. In these areas the rural households have no access to water during the dry season.Most use water from tube wells or open wells, while a small minority uses tanks and springs. Hence, there is a high dependence on groundwater for drinking and other domestic purposes. </p>
                                        <p>Poor rural households collect water from community sources, which are often remote and spend much time in collecting water. The collected water is a major causeof waterborne diseases. </p>
                                        <p>Diseases due to contamination of drinking water constitute a major burden on health as most of these vulnerable populace do not have adequate access to health facilities and even insurance.Improvement in the quality of drinking water will significantly benefit the health and wellbeing of people. </p>
                                        <p>Therefore, the organization is working towards providing safe drinking water to the maximum extent possible in its target villages. </p>
                                        <p>Children are perhaps the most cheerful and omnipresent facet of rural villages. Curious, unafraid to stare, and ready to smile, they are unconcerned about their running noses, bare feet, unkept hair and ragged clothes. If they are fortunate enough to have a school anda regular and dedicated teacher and if their parents can spare them from work, they get an education. </p>
                                        <p>But more often than not, the conditions are not ripe. They are often uninformed about health issues, hygiene and sanitation, since their mothers are often uninformed too. </p>
