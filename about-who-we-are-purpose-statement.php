                                    The World is in need of a unifying message. There are over 7.7 billion people on the planet. One in seven live in extreme poverty. There is a continuous displacement of millions each year due to climate change and conflict.</p> 
                                    <p>In Tampa Florida, a midsize city with a booming economy, over 100,000 people rely on daily food donations.

                                    <p>The 222 algorithm is a unique approach to address the existential challenges humanity faces regarding the urgent need and sustainable dignified access to clean water, nutritional food and secure shelter.</p>
                                    <p> It is guided by Science, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the US Declaration of Independence. We recognize the inalienable rights of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
