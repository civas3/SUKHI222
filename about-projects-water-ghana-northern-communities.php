                                <p>SUKHI 222 GHANA, an NGO geared toward solving water problems has been all out
                                    in its strategic operations in Ghana, specifically at the Northern Communities
                                    in the country. As popularly known, water is life. But the sources of water in
                                    these identified communities rather deteriorate the lives of the inhabitants
                                    than being life ameliorating to them.</p>

                                <p>To demonstrate his kind courtesy towards achieving the aim of SUKHI 222
                                    International, the founder of the organization, Charles Holsopple donated water
                                    filters for the project.</p>
                                <p>The project was planned, organized and executed by Emmanuel Adam Jnr Awo and
                                    the SUKHI 222 Ghana team.
                                </p>
                                <p>Having received the shipment of 82 water filters to Ghana to donate to
                                    deprived communities, we have been able to reach out to seven communities.
                                    Laligu was the first community we donated ten (10) water filters to.</p>
                                <p>Being the first community that SUKHI 222 Ghana has been supporting, they
                                    received 10 local water filters last year, sponsored by the CEO of SUKHI 222
                                    Ghana, and ten (10) extra water filters were donated to them this year.
                                </p>
                                <p>In responding to the appeal of bad water situation in Northern Region, SUKHI
                                    222 in its benevolence supplied water filters with veronica buckets to seven
                                    communities for helping their “irresistible dam water” problems.
                                </p>
                                <p>This operation was carried out by the Head of Operations for Ghana, Mr
                                    Emmanuel Adam Jnr Awo (SUKHI 222) standing from right, and presented to Mr.
                                    Christopher Boatin of Growing Trees Network Ghana, standing at the left, to
                                    Zoroborgu, Jailo, Kpandu, Janyilli, Daboashie and Datoyilli communities
                                    respectively.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Two water filters each were donated to these communities to enable them drink
                                    clean filtered water and not what they consume daily from their dams.
                                </p>
                                <p>In distributing the items to the beneficiaries, each household of ten (10)
                                    members had one water filter for the first benefiting community for ten
                                    households.
                                </p>
                                <p>Besides that, ten local water filters were donated to the community, one per
                                    a household. However, there are still more of 2000 members to donate to. With
                                    the other remaining six communities, one veronica bucket and two water filters
                                    each were donated to twenty households.
                                </p>
                                <p>This therefore runs number of beneficiaries to a total of two hundred and
                                    twenty (220) members.
                                </p>
