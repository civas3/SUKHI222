                    Our mission is to advocate for the dignified access of adequate food, water and
                    shelter for the global population. To educate and enable every individual to
                    achieve and maintain a self-sustainability in a cohesive and healthy society
                    with others and with our environment.

                <div class="gold-border"></div>
                <p>
                    Scalable, sustainable, dignified, affordable access to a minimum of 2 gallons of
                    fresh water, 2,000 nutritional calories and 200 cubic ft of secure tenure are
                    essential to achieving Peace and Justice and should be considered a Universal
                    Human Right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The essence of SUKHI 222 recognizes the need for food, water and shelter
                    transcends all subgroups of humanity and in fact is essential in all forms of
                    life. When these are recognized as human rights and supported by both public and
                    private sectors the result is what must be called a CIVIL society.
                </p>
                <p>We promote these goals as a universal measure and support regional
                    multidisciplinary teams to develop systemic methodologies addressing critical
                    urgent needs and sustainable practices to address the challenges of the 21st
                    century and beyond.</p>

                    offer guidance on methodologies for funding, and implementation of those
                    improvements. Prioritize funding for efforts that leave the longest lasting and
