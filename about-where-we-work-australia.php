                                    I started my working career as a scientist however transitioned out of the
                                    laboratory at a young age. Over 20+ years I have worked in commercial science
                                    and healthcare servicing a range of industries from hospitals, diagnostic
                                    pathology, research and academia, pharmaceutical, food, and environmental
                                    sectors. My responsibilities have spanned across account management, business
                                    development, sales management, and general management. I have successfully
                                    achieved and exceeded the expectations of the companies that I have worked with.
                                    I have done so by being driven by a passion to serve the customer to the highest
                                    standards with honesty and integrity. I have always had a thirst for knowledge
                                    and a passion for growing and progressing. In parallel to my career, I have had
                                    a keen interest in personal development. I have studied with the likes of Tony
                                    Robbins, Robert Kiyosaki, Dean Grazosi, Wim Hof, to name a few. I am a qualified
                                    life coach and NLP practitioner and have used these skills to both develop
                                    myself and assist others to be the best versions of themselves. In my view you
                                    are either progressing or decaying in life. So, whilst I walk this earth I would
                                    rather continue to keep moving forward and evolving.
