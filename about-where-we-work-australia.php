                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started my working career as a scientist however transitioned out of the
                        laboratory at a young age. Over 20+ years I have worked in commercial science
                        and healthcare servicing a range of industries from hospitals, diagnostic
                        pathology, research and academia, pharmaceutical, food, and environmental
                        sectors. My responsibilities have spanned across account management, business
                        development, sales management, and general management. I have successfully
                        achieved and exceeded the expectations of the companies that I have worked with.
                        I have done so by being driven by a passion to serve the customer to the highest
                        standards with honesty and integrity. I have always had a thirst for knowledge
                        and a passion for growing and progressing. In parallel to my career, I have had
                        a keen interest in personal development. I have studied with the likes of Tony
                        Robbins, Robert Kiyosaki, Dean Grazosi, Wim Hof, to name a few. I am a qualified
                        life coach and NLP practitioner and have used these skills to both develop
                        myself and assist others to be the best versions of themselves. In my view you
                        are either progressing or decaying in life. So, whilst I walk this earth I would
                        rather continue to keep moving forward and evolving.
