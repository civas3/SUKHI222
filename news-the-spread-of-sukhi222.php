                                    <p>Food insecurity before the COVID-19 epidemic was a real and immediate crisis
                                        in our local community and worldwide. According to feeding America over 37
                                        million people in the United States face hunger on a daily basis. Over 1 billion
                                        people are malnourished worldwide.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Here in the Tampa Bay area FeedingTampaBay.org was feeding over 70,000 people
                                        even before the pandemic. Along with many other organizations efforts reach well
                                        over 100,000 people relying on food assistance here in the Tampa Bay area.</p>

                                        On behalf of SUKHI 222 I am grateful to be welcomed by the USF Food Sovereignty
                                        Group that is addressing food scarcity in the Tampa Bay area.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I am encouraged to know several departments are active in the coalition. The
                                        group has the attention of many NGOS that are also working to build sustainable
                                        food supply to those most in need.</p>
                                    <p>SUKHI 222‘s approach looks at the basic needs of food, water and shelter for
                                        the individual to survive and puts them into useful finite quantities.

                                    <p>
                                        This is empowering to better understand the situation and direct actions
                                        necessary to relieve suffering and build resilient communities with no one left

                                    <p>That is where the education system will play a large part. The formation of
