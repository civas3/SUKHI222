                    <p>Food insecurity before the COVID-19 epidemic was a real and immediate crisis
                        in our local community and worldwide. According to feeding America over 37
                        million people in the United States face hunger on a daily basis. Over 1 billion
                        people are malnourished worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here in the Tampa Bay area FeedingTampaBay.org was feeding over 70,000 people
                        even before the pandemic. Along with many other organizations efforts reach well
                        over 100,000 people relying on food assistance here in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
                    <p>
                        On behalf of SUKHI 222 I am grateful to be welcomed by the USF Food Sovereignty
                        Group that is addressing food scarcity in the Tampa Bay area.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am encouraged to know several departments are active in the coalition. The
                        group has the attention of many NGOS that are also working to build sustainable
                        food supply to those most in need.</p>
                    <p>SUKHI 222‘s approach looks at the basic needs of food, water and shelter for
                        the individual to survive and puts them into useful finite quantities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is empowering to better understand the situation and direct actions
                        necessary to relieve suffering and build resilient communities with no one left
                        behind whether here in the US or anywhere humankind resides.</p>

                    <p>As a formula to help guide and coordinate a global movement of resulting in
                        widespread support of local NGOs activities.

                        Accurate data and reliable algorithms are essential in making critical decisions
                        that will avoid unintended consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>That is where the education system will play a large part. The formation of
                        student clubs in Nepal, Ghana and Australia is in motion.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because of the systemic nature of the problem we are inviting representatives
                        from each department from Agriculture to Zoology to co-create candidate
                        methodologies required to solve immediate needs and build a sustainable future
                        where 222 for all is achieved.

                        I believe students that are involved in social and environmental sciences will
                        be particularly attracted to participate.

                    <p>SUKHI 222 is envisioned to become a global movement. We have been successful
